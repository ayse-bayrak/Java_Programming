    Instance is object member, belong to object.

    All the objects came from class, so whatever the class has all the objects

2. Circle Task:
1. Create a class named Circle:

				Attributes:
					instance: radius, diameter
					static: pi

				Add a constructor that can set All the fields (instances)
					HINT: we only need to know the radius to set the radius & diameter

				Actions:
					calcArea(): returns the area of the circle
					calcPerimeter(): returns the perimeter of Circle
					printPi(): displays the PI value
					toString(): displays the radius, diameter, pi, area, and perimeter of the circle when the object of a circle is passed in the print statement
